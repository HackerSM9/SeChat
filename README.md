## How to Use SempChat 🚦

### Step 1: Registration 🔴

1. Open the SempChat app on your browser.


2. Enter a unique username and choose a 4-6 digit PIN. (Tip: PIN should be strong for added security.)



### Step 2: Partner Connection 🟡

1. Enter your partner's username and PIN in the provided fields.


2. Both users need to input the same details to establish a connection.
